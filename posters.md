# How to handle poster sessions?

Posters are a common staple in research and academic conferences.  My first poster was a graduate student presentation during my first semester of graduate school. Since then I have presented at least 10 different posters related to work in my research career. Posters are an easy way for conference organizers to get more presenters (and thus attendees) without requiring the time for all of the presenters to stand and give presentations in sequence.

> The first posters appeared at least as early as 1967 at the [Carshalton Medical Research Centre](https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/62/1/4/1720006) in Great Britain. These were 'prepared cards' on which researchers gathered results, mostly graphs and tables â€“ in fact, the material was usually shown by slides; the leaves were placed on panels and the authors stood at their sides for a discussion. This type of presentation, born in the field of biochemistry, won the whole discipline, then in the year 1975 it was introduced at the international and national congresses of all life and matter sciences.

In the United States, the meteorological society appears to have the honors of the earliest poster session ([online](https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/bams/57/6/1520-0477-57_6_696.pdf)). In a summary of the conference they went on to describe these 'posters' from the meteorological conference.

> About one-third of the papers presented at the conference were "poster" presentations. Rather than losing time in coffee breaks, part of each half-day session was devoted to this type of presentation. Authors prepared posters (3 ft X 5 ft) outlining the major points of their work. The "audience" moved from poster to poster as individuals, entering into discussions with the poster authors as interest dictated. Both participants and the audience found this to be an effective way to exchange information. In our opinion, all AMS conferences should consider this highly efficient means of encouraging scientific interchange.

## Why do posters matter?

As mentioned above, posters provide conferences with a means to present a massive amount of science to a large and highly diverse audience.  But why do posters matter to those presenting them? Posters offer an excellent opportunity to summarize your work to a broader audience.  Done well, they force you to figure out how to present your work to an audience that is intelligent but not involved in your work.

1. As developers, researchers, or scientists, our work takes us very deep into the weeds. Taking the time to step out of the weeds and figure out how to explain our work to a group that isn't in the details is a valuable skill to develop.
2. The resulting posters are valuable resources to have for your future work. You can quickly bring up these posters when questions about your previous work arise in interviews or other meetings.
3. Organizing your thoughts and work into a poster can often spark new ideas for future work as you consider its applicability to a broader audience.

Finally, sometimes they don't matter. Often, poster sessions can be a letdown as the number of visitors to your poster is limited during a session. 

## How do I make a good poster?

- Goal 1: [Maximize insight](https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58?si=1octBUEmmIpgOA3a&t=641)
- Goal 2: [Keep the good stuff](https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58?si=-RD5aWcpqM01JyHV&t=665)
- Goal 3: [Make it easy](https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58?si=RFpmSz28XxpXQ5Hx&t=673)

Notice that there isn't a goal to prove to your nerdy friends back in the office how smart you are in statistics or programming.  Clearly communicating insight by highlighting the good stuff shows intelligence.  Many equations and code snippets often fail to provide significant value.

## Can I get some help with the tools and the printing process?

- You can print your posters using [Print and Copy Services through BYU-Idaho](https://www.byui.edu/print/list-of-services/posters).  We will use a 3-foot-wide by 4-foot-tall size.  The Mathematics department will cover the cost of printing.
- You could bring a monitor and display your poster or interactive app/website as your poster as well.
- Historically, I have used Photoshop to develop my posters. Now, I use [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/). It is so easy and built for use by designers and for printing. As a student, it is [free | Canva students](https://www.canva.com/education/students/). Our printing office will accept a Slide built in PowerPoint as well.
