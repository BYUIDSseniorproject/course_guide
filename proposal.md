## Introduction

Your senior project requires that you submit a proposal several weeks before the start of your senior project semester.  In many of your data science courses you have completed smaller week-long or semester-long projects.  You could use some ideas from those projects to build out a proposal that would require approximately 126 hours of work to complete.  We have provided some guidance on this proposal below.

### Submission

Please name the file `lastname_firstname_seniorproject.md` or `lastname_firstname_seniorproject.pdf`.

##  Proposal Sections

Your proposal should be one page in length.  It should include the following sections and information.

* Personal Background
* Project Background
* Domain to Investigate
* Proposed Deliverables
* Faculty Request (499R Only)

### Personal Background

This section should have 2-3 sentences that identify if you have completed MATH 425, CS 450, and MATH 488.  It would be best if you also stated what career field you are interested in and what your plans are after graduating.  Please include your byui.edu email in the background section.

### Project Background

This section has a short description of the interesting question that you would like to address. It should provide some motivation as to why this question is important and how you will find data to answer the question.  Note that you can work with a faculty mentor to come up with ideas for your draft proposal if needed.

### Domain to Investigate

In this section, you could note a domain you will need to study during your senior project to be able to complete the work.  You could list the critical topics in that domain that will need to be considered.  For example, if you were going to do a project around investments and stock trading, you would need to document the domain and list a few key elements that will be helpful in your learning of that domain. 

### Proposed Deliverables

You do not need to include the standard deliverables that all projects are required to do (blog, resume, and final presentation). Instead, list deliverables that are unique to your project. What are the specific elements of your project that you need to complete before presenting your work?  Examples of deliverables could include

* Impute missing values in my dataset 
* Apply the random forest model to predict .... for my .....
* Explain the details of the .... domain to motivate my problem.
* Learn and implement Plotly to have interactive graphics for my results graphics

### Faculty Request

In this section list three faculty members that you think could support your project.  Note your preferred faculty member and provide a short justification for requesting that faculty mentor.  

*Note: this section does not need to be filled out if you are registered for the 499D class.*
