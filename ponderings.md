## What should we think about?

### Stop Comparing Yourself to AI

`warnings: profanity`

Why do we keep comparing AI to humans?

Jaron Lanier — virtual reality pioneer, digital philosopher, and the author of several best-selling books on technology — thinks that we should stop. In his view, technology is only valuable if it has beneficiaries. So instead of asking "What can AI do?," we should be asking, "What can AI do for us?"

﻿In today’s episode, Jaron and Sean discuss a humanist approach to AI and how changing our understanding of AI tools could change how we use, develop, and improve them.

`warnings: none`

I was fascinated to listen to these two podcasts.  Each person presented clear arguments that were in stark contrast to one another. Can we discuss the structure of arguments and how our worldview influences them?
