# Syllabus


## Course Objectives

Students will;

1. Demonstrate proficiency in the core languages and tools of data science.
2. Find, format, and explore 'large' unformatted data for their domain of interest.
3. Implement Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, or Artificial Intelligence tools for analysis.
4. Present their work through oral and social mediums.

## Senior Project Background

Some program years have more than one class listed for your senior project.  **We would like you to take MATH 499R.**  You will need to get the MATH 499R teacher to give you permission to add the course. Your senior project is an opportunity for you to build a portfolio of work that documents your skill sets as an undergraduate data scientist.  Here is [an example](https://byuidatascience.github.io/WolfeA_SeniorProject) from [Andrew Wolfe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akwolfe/).  Each project will also need to include a [publishable article](https://byuidatascience.github.io/WolfeA_SeniorProject/article.html) that will be shared on our [LinkedIn Data science group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13537407/).

The type of data or coding that you tackle does not have to be like Andrew's project.  Some students have built R packages for clients as an example of something different.  However, we do want your senior project to start a project from raw data and grow to a final analysis or other data science deliverable. Each student will also be required to present at the [Research and Creative Works Conference](http://www.byui.edu/research-and-creative-works-conference) (R&CW)

## Timeline

Your senior project is built to give you a space to develop your own final product as a data science major. It is important to think about when and how this class is taken during your major.  

### In program

We recommend that you take it your last semester and expect that you will take it during your senior year.  This is a capstone experience for you to demonstrate to yourself and employers that you can use the tools you have learned throughout the data science program to complete original self-directed work.

You will be responsible to submit a [project proposal](project.html) before the semester of your senior project credits begins.  This proposal will be a one-page document that proposes a novel question or problem that you would like to address.  The proposal should include information about the type of data you will need to find and a list of professors that you would prefer to be your mentor on the project.

### During Class

This senior project is self-directed.  Your faculty mentor will work with you to have 1-hour scheduled for supporting your project.  You will be responsible to complete 126 hours of work on your project to be able to earn an A grade.  Your hours together with your deliverables documented below will define your final grade in your senior project. We will use [clockify.me](clockify.me) to record your hours weekly. 

## Deliverables and Grading

Each project will have its own unique deliverables that will be negotiated in the project proposal listed below.  For example, some projects could require the development of an R package, a presentation to a client, or deeper learning of machine learning techniques.  All projects are expected to have the following deliverables delivered during the semester at the specified week in the semester.
